## Directed Graph Problem
The codes within this repo is developed to solve certain set of problems that has been assigned.
A certain set of functions must be developed as well. This is done so that the user can manipulate the 
graph according to their preferences.

The directed graph is given, and the following should be done:
  1) Check if the graph is strongly connected.
  2) Check if the there's any cycle formed within the graph.
  3) Determine the shortest path between 2 vertex where for this problem, the vertex represents the
  cities. [Dijkstra's algorithm is used]
